For week one of class, we reviewed the syllabus and went over learning outcomes for the rest of the semester. We also reviewed how to set up the site you are currently viewing this weekly review on and set up our github repo for D6. For reference the link for my github is: alex-waldron/E322 (github.com). Along with this, we were prompted to look at each exercise as an assistant to develop a senior design project for next year. I look forward to what the rest of the semester has to bring.
